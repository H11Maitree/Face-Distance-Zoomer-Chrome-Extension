The breakpoint currently an be set in JSON format; I didn't have the capacity to make a slider and abolish the face width exposition to the end-user at the moment. **For the ideal proposed design of this setting page, please refer to the report and figures;** this extension shows the feature's feasibility only, not the design representation.


## Credits
I want to give out recognition to [Webcam Preview](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/webcam-preview/becngjhkfeeldhnjgbgndeedogbnaejg), an existing Chrome extension, as we fork the initial code (camera display over the webpage module) before implementing the face detection functions and binding to zooming on top of their work. Without it will take a longer time to develop this repository. 

However, as mentioned, apart from camera display over webpage behaviour, all core feature of this project is developed by us.
